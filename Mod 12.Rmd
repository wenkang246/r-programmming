# R Markdown Practice
## This is an R Markdown document. 
I will use this document to practice R Markdown formatting. For example, in R Markdown I can make lists both 
1. Ordered
  + (with a subitem)
and
* Unordered
  + (with a subitem)

I can emphasize words by *italicising* or **bolding** or even ~~strikethrough~~

### Adding R Code chunks is also easy:
```{r}
summary(cars$dist)
summary(cars$speed)
```
or even inline code. For example, there were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied in the **mtcars** dataset.

At the end of it all, simpily click on **Knit** and the markup document will generate!
